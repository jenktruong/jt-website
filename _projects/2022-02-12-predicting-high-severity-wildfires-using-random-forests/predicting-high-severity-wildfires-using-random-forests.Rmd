For my Conservation Planning class at Bren, my final assignment was to conduct a research project to practice using conservation planning tools we learned in class. This gave me an opportunity to explore other topics about my masterâ€™s group thesis project that are outside the scope. With a partner, we asked how likely areas of high severity wildfires will occur within San Bernardino National Forests, specifically within yellow pine and mixed conifer (YPMC) forests.

We utilized a Random Forests model to find which variables are likely to be important predictor variables for fire severity. The following datasets were gathered from these sources:

I combined them into one shapefile using the **Extract Multi Values to Points** tool. I exported the attribute table as a dBase table and CSV for the input of the Random Forests model. After running the R code for the model, my partner found that NDVI and climatic water deficit (CWD) were considered to be important. I went back to our map to find areas that had high vegetation density and high CWD.

One area was in the westernmost part of San Bernardino National Forest; this area has high vegetation density. At the end of the project, we found two major areas that were predicted to have high fire severity overall.

Because this was a class assignment and it was the first time with machine learning for both of us, our Random Forests analysis was a lot simpler than we would have liked, but I still learned a lot. Now that I'm determined to pursue a career in data analysis, I may come across machine learning more often.
