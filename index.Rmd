I am a Master's graduate from the Bren school of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I started my career with a focus on conservation biology, although nowadays, I am currently working on my data analysis skills. My hobbies include hiking, visiting museums, and playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons!
